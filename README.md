# World Cup Quiz CI Project 2

The idea behind this project, was to have a quiz for football lovers to try their knowledge about the game. The questions here are from the 2022 FIFA World Cup hosted by Qatar and there are 10 questions. After adding your username as requested, you are taken to the quiz. For each question you get write a check mark to support your answer shows besides it and correct answer counter shows what number of answers you got write below, while "X" for wrong answer choices and incorrect counter shows likewise. At the end, your total score is presented to you, and you are requested to provide feedback thereafter.

      1. Every first time visitor can clearly see that this is a FIFA world cup quiz site.
      2. The site is there to test their sports knowledge about football.
  - As a first time visitor, I want navigate the site intuitively.
      1. Navigating the site is very intuitive, as how to navigate the site is easy and, the needed response from users are clear and unambiguous.
  - As a first time visitor, I want to look for testimonials to know what others think.
      1. At the moment testimonies of users are not public yet. That is currently under consideration.

- Returning Visitor Goals
  
  - As a returning visitor, I want to see what changes/ improvements have been made to the site.
      1. Further changes are currently under consideration, however, there is no specific time for their implementation.

- Frequent User Goals

  - As a frequent user, I want to see if new quiz questions have been added.
      1. No new changes to the site yet.
  - As a frequent user, I want to see if the comments of users impact changes on the site.

![JSHint Validator Check](assets/readme-images/jshint-validation-photo.PNG)

-Lighthouse audit: Archieved 100% accessiblity, best practices and SEO checks. However, the site performance is at 74% - the lowest. This issue has to do with my chrome extension.

## Fixed Bug

- I was'nt able to call the user's name entry before telling them their quiz score. This issue was based on the variable assigned to the name entry being block scoped. I fixed this issue by declaring the variable outside the scope making it a global varaiable.

## Unfixed Bugs

- Yet to fix my chrome extension issues affecting the site's performance rating.

## Libraries and Programs Used

- Github: To Store Repository
- Codeanywhere: To Create the html and css files
- Google Fonts: Font-family 'Open Sans' and fallback "sans serif"
- Google Chrome Dev Tools: For testing.
- Microsoft Edge: Alternative browser for site testing
- Font Awesome: Social media icons
