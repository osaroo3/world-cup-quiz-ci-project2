### Navigation

There are three navigation links in this project, and they are located at the top right side of the users screen. However, for phone screen, because of its size the navigation link has been compessed into an icon (bars), so that, when clicked the users have access to these navigation links. They can be accessed easily, and also there to enable users navigate between the three pages of this website.

# Testing

Testing of the website was done by me. I open the link on different browsers (Chrome and MS Edge) to be certain they where rendered as I expected. Certain html contents where out of position. This was corrected using appropriate CSS styling.

I have checked to confirm that forms cannot be submitted without valid entries.

I have ensured that this project is responsive on all screens.
